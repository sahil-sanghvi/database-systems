/*
Pizza Database

Instructions:
- This part of the assignment uses a small relational schema with data
  about people, pizzerias, pizzas, and prices.

- The script below:
    * Creates the tables (Person, Frequents, Eats, Serves).
    * Populates them with sample data.

- Your task:
    * Write SQL queries to answer each question (Q1–Q7).
    * For each question, replace the "Your query here" placeholder
      with your solution.
    * Write the corresponding Relational Algebra (RA) expressions
      for these questions in a separate PDF file named pizza_ra.pdf.
      - Handwritten RA is fine, as long as it is clear and legible.

Submission:
- Submit this completed SQL file with all your queries filled in.
- Submit the pizza_ra.pdf file with your RA solutions.
- Ensure your SQL queries run correctly against the provided schema.
